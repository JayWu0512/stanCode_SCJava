## 👨‍💻 About Me

In Oct 2023, I decided to pursue a career in programming, exploring the integration between the fields of accounting and programming, and I am currently navigating this path.

## 📆 My Journey

I have conquered SC001 and SC101 courses, giving me skills similar to what's taught in Stanford's CS106B. To gain knowledge in various programming languages, I enrolled in the SCJava workshop to enhance my skills in Java, C, and C++. I believe that building a strong foundation in these programming languages will contribute to a brighter future for me.
